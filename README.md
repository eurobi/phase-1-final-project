# phase-1-final-project

SUMMARY
This project is a single page web application for the purposes of assisting with a fantasy basketball draft.  

FUNCTIONALITY - USER FACING
When users navigate to the page they will find a title with a single search bar where they can enter any active or former NBA player.

The results of the search will appear in individual cards, up to 25 results.  Those cards will include a players name, position (if available in the DB), and team.

A user can click on any individual player and all other players will dissapear. The clicked on players stats for the past 5 years will display on the page.  If they don't have stats for all 5 years, available years will show. If there are no stats for that player for the last 5 years, an alert will appear.

The user can click on any stat to display a chart of that stat over the available years.

If the user wants to add that player to their 'team', they can click the plus button next to the players name.  A side bar will display, featuring the players chosen and their cummulative stats.
